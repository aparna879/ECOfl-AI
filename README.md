# ECOfl-AI

• The user will report the location of the un-attended garbage.
• After getting requests, we will cluster the location of request generated. (DBSCAN)
• Using Image Recognition we can rate the importance of the garbage.
• We will find shortest route for collecting the waste. (TSP)
• The app will learn the pattern of request generated and pattern, when the garbage is generated at which location.
• After collecting, we can recycle it and sell it to different industries, generate biomass and sell it or sell it to 3d printer manufacturer for the filler.
• We will have a reward point system for the user who will report the location.
