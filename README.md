# ECOfl-AI

• The user will report the location of the un-attended garbage.<br/>
• After getting requests, we will cluster the location of request generated. (DBSCAN)<br/>
• Using Image Recognition we can rate the importance of the garbage.<br/>
• We will find shortest route for collecting the waste. (TSP)<br/>
• The app will learn the pattern of request generated and pattern, when the garbage is generated at which location. <br/>
• After collecting, we can recycle it and sell it to different industries, generate biomass and sell it or sell it to 3d printer manufacturer for the filler.<br/>
• We will have a reward point system for the user who will report the location.<br/>
